0.5.4
-----
The django admin 'create user' page is currently broken on a clean django install using longerusernameandemail. These three commits fix it up:

 * in f2ce156
   * django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm doesn't define an 'email' field by default
   * there's no need to 'update_field_length' on the UserCreationForm or UserChangeForm email fields since these fields are generated by a ModelForm - so they'll use the max_length parameter from the model layer, which has been already updated by our monkey patching.
 * in 4baac16 added tests for the basic CRUD functionality of the django admin interface.
